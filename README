QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager
This is the version customized for the Primestation One
https://github.com/free5ty1e/primestationone
 ------------------------------------

QtSixA can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3, Keypads and Remotes)
to a Linux-compatible machine.

"QtSixA" is the GUI (interface), while "sixad" is the backend C++ code.

Currently sixad supports:
 - Sixaxis/DualShock3 (buttons, axis, accelerometers, leds and rumble)
 - PS3 Keypads
 - PS3 BD Remotes

This version of sixad will NOT register the hardware's MAC/ID in the device name
(ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller").

QtSixA and sixad are licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license.
